👋 Hey
💻 I build things with Java, C++, HTML, CSS, and Android Studio.
Right now, I’m focusing on creating my developer portfolio — the first step to being visible as a coder.

🚀 Why I’m Here
Sharing my coding journey openly
Growing my skills with real projects
Building a portfolio that speaks louder than a CV

🌱 How You Can Help Me Grow
⭐ Star my repositories (it motivates a lot!)
📝 Suggest improvements or new project ideas
🤝 Collaborate on beginner-friendly builds
📢 Share my repos if you find them useful
📂 Portfolio in Progress

I’m working on my developer portfolio website — soon it’ll be live!
Stay tuned: I’ll be adding templates, guides, and open-source components here.
